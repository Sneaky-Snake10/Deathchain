# Deathchain
A repository which should hopefully never be used.

Hi, it's me, the author! I'm writing this message right now rather than later, just for safety.
It's fairly simple to envision dark fantasies and alternate realities, but this is a lot more subtle.
If it's already happened, you should have the password. The cryptography tool is in scrambler.py, the only fully decrypted part of this operation.

Unfortunately, I don't want to explain too much more about what this repository does until it's needed, so I'll drop the rest into an encrypted file, README.enc.

For curious and bright minds:
This isn't the kind of mystery to be solved. 
I'm not trying to be edgy, cool, or plant an ARG here - this repo serves only one purpose, and that purpose is a highly sensitive and personal one I don't want shared.
As for the sequences of symbols? They are markers for a script, nothing else.



Note to self: If you ever lose the password, remember that hackerman website you made for your first foray into school unblocking?
